# Implementation-of-Rubik-s-Cube-like-connectivity-for-FPGA
This project implements a logic design for a 3x3 Rubikâ€™s cube using VHDL in Xilinx Vivado. It simulates computational units (CUs) across the cube's faces, supporting operations like addition, multiplication, shift, and logical operations. The design enables data transfer between CUs and tests all operations listed in the problem statement.
